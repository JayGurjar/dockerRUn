Alright, first install docker from google, install Android studio and node > 16, you would also Android SDK 30 (subversions dont matter)
Run docker --version to see if its working
If it is, yayy, then cd to the current working director and run docker compose build (it will take a while to run). Lmk if it doesnt go through
If that goes through successfully, run npm run android
